The final project of the course on Reinforcement Learning was the implementation of a Battleship Game, where we implemented both the environment and the agent. The folder contains three different codes: 
- V1: Simple reward function and algorithms from the Labs with very few adaptation. 
- V2: More complex reward function and simple DQN to learn from thousands of episode (very good results on a simple problem). We also have here all the part about adversarial agent.
- V3: Attempt to add complex methods but impossible to increase the complexity of the problem
